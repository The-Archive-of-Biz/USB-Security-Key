# USB Authentication Tool

This is a python script that allows users to set up a USB device to sign onto their windows device.

## Setup
To set it up, please download all the files into a directory, and run the `setup.py` file, to configure your USB and device to run. Please do not delete the `config.ini` file, as this will cause the program to break.
You should also import the `USB Tool.xml` file into **Windows Task Scheduler**, to get the program to run.
It's recommended to remove your password, as this script works instead of your password.
